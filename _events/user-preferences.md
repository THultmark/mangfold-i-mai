## What is this workshop about?
Accessibility is all about tailoring the user experience to an individualâ€™s needs. Allowing users to state their requirements and preferences supports their need for accommodations and also allows web developers to react to them, delivering better user experiences. New CSS specifications and testing tools allow developers to respect these settings with ease.

## Who is it for?
Developers and designers.

## Registration
Coming soon - Limited number of participants.
